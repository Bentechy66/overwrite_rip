One of our team wants to use this Really Awesome Console Application, but they don't want to pay for it. Can you help them keygen it (without patching the binary) and generate a license key for the username "John Smith"?

## Files
 - [really_awesome_console_application.exe](really_awesome_console_application.pem)

## Verify your solution
To win: Simply generate a valid key for the program - without patching it.

The executable is not malicious.

Those of you wishing to verify your solution: the sha256sum of the only valid solution, with no trailing newline, begins `b362895`. There is no other valid solution; if you've got one and the program accepts it then you have triggered something which is altering your license. Cracking the hash is *not* considered a valid solution ;)
